# FabAcademy - Resources

This repository is for curated resources and projects created by Fab Academy instructors/students around the world to support Fab Academy program. The resources hosted here complement the [tutorials](http://docs.academany.org/FabAcademy-Tutorials/_book/) with useful resources.
